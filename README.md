# Russian-Roulette-Game

### Project Description

This is a group project.

The project was to recreate the Russian Roulette game in Python, using the basic knowledge acquired during the first week of the bootcamp. This game was selected because of its research/guessing angles.

### Rules

In this version of the game the codifier is simply played by the computer. 
- The player is allowed to place a bet between 5$ & 1000$ 
- The player is allowed to choose the level of the game, but choosing his/her gun. Each guns corresponds to a level (easy, intermediate, difficult) based on the number of bullet in the gun.

At each step, the computer displays weither the bullet was deadly or not. 
- If it is deadly : the player looses, the game stops, the bet is completely lost.
- If it is not deadly : the player's bet is multiplied (by 2, 3, or 5 depending of the level choosen), and the player is allowed to play again, or to stop playing and leaving with his/her gain.

The only possible way to gain, is to choose to quit the game before a deadly shoot.

### Workflow

First the main organisation was thinking about on Thursday, the functions to compare the combinations and to format the player's guess. Eventually on Saturday and Sunday, all the functions were made and fixed. The game was tested several times to check if it works with different settings and combinations.

### Organization

The code was made with Jupyter, and using Zoom in the same time to discuss about the ideas and the way to write it.
